GSEA-InContext: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis In Context
========

NOTE: This is a stripped-down copy of the GSEA-InContext Python package. It has all graphics- and plot-related functionality removed so that it can be used on shinyapps.io, which cannot use packages that require access to the display (e.g., packages that require Tcl/Tk). The full package with plotting capability is [here](https://pypi.org/project/gsea-incontext).
